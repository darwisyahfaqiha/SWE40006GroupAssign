## Usage

The DevOps Pipeline provides a comprehensive set of tools and workflows to streamline your development and deployment processes. Here are some common tasks:

- **Development**: Create feature branches, make code changes, and submit pull requests for code review.

- **Testing**: Automate testing using continuous integration tools. For example, our CI/CD pipeline includes Travis CI for automated testing.

- **Deployment**: Deploy your application to various environments (e.g., development, staging, production) using CI/CD workflows.

- **Monitoring**: Implement monitoring and alerting systems (e.g., Grafana and Prometheus) to track your application's performance.

- **Security**: Use security scanning tools (e.g., SonarQube) to identify and address security vulnerabilities.

- **Documentation**: Maintain project documentation, including API documentation and developer guides.
